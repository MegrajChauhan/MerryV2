Merry allows libararies to be loaded dynamically. The libararies are not a merry input file but a binary file
containing machine code that the host can execute. This means that compiled C libararies can be loaded and
used by Merry programs. This is not limited to just C but also with any programming language that doesn't
have function overloading.

To load a library, the dynl service interrupt can be used. The return value of the interrupt will be in the Ma
register. A handle will be returned in the Mb register which can be used to access the functions from that
loaded library. 
To remove the library, the dynul service interrupt can be used. 

Each dynamically loaded function will receive a pointer to a memory location from data memory through
which it should be able to access its needed variables.

The dyncall service interrupt will make the call.

dynl:
This interrupt requires an address to a null-terminated string in the memory.
The address should be in the Ma register. The handle will be returned in the Mb register.

dynul:
The handle must be in the Mb register.

dyncall:
The handle must be in the Mb register. The address to the name of the function in the Ma
register. The address to the parameter in the Mc register.
