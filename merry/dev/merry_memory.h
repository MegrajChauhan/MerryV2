 BIG PROBLEM:
 Since making the atomic operations at the memory level is going to be very tough and complicated, we have to implement it at the CPU level.
 The only way that is coming to mind right now is by blocking every other core during atomic memory accesses. If i can come up with a way to make things work
 without hampering the performance, i will implement it right away but at memory level, it is very very complicated.

 The memory is going to be an array of bytes. It will follow the page model while using the endianness of the host to make things faster.
